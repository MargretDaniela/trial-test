#Question 1(a)
#create a program that calculates the area of a triangle.

base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle :"))

height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle :"))

area = (1/2) * height * base

print(f"The area of a triangle of height {height} and base {base} is = {area:.3f}")
